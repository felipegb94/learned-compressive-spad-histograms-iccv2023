## This model pre-computes depths and then generates a histogram from each depth whose only non-zero bin corresponds to the depth
# Then we input that histogram into the DDFN_C64B10_NL model

# Model ID is used to select the correct model objcet
model_id: DDFN_C64B10_Depth2Depth
model_params:
  in_channels: 1
# Model name is used for saving results
model_name: ${.model_id}
